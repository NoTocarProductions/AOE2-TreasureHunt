# AOE2-TreasureHunt
This is a game I made during my studies as a full stack developer. The game is inspired on the classic RTS Game 'Age of Empires II'. Used languages include HTML5, CSS and Javascript in an MVC structure. Try to avoid your enemy, the walls and pick up all the treasures in the least amount of possible time.


To start the game you should open 'treasureHuntForm.html' on a live server. This is a game to be ran strictly and only local due to copyrights on images.

Feel free to make improvements or expand the game with extra features.

There are two bugs active in the game being:
1) From time to time when a treasure has been picked up the class doesn't change back to 'grass' when moving on with the player to another cell.
2) Same problem as above but with the collision of player and enemy the class doesn't change back to 'grass' when moving to another cell.

To improve/ To do's:
Don't make the enemy spawn right next to / or on the player.
Avoid random wall spawn around the player at start-up.
...


Enjoy!
